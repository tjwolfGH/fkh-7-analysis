## Overview

This repository accompanies the above manuscript and includes:

- **Python analysis and plotting code** used to process quantitative data and
  generate preliminary figures
- **A Fiji/ImageJ Jython script** used for automated image processing and
  fluorescence quantification

The code is provided to support transparency, reproducibility, and reuse of the
analysis pipeline described in the manuscript.


## AI-assisted code development statement

Portions of the code in this repository were developed with the assistance of
large language models.

- The Python-based analysis and plotting scripts were developed with the aid of
  ChatGPT (OpenAI), which was used to assist with code structure, debugging, and
  refactoring. All scripts were reviewed, tested, and modified by the authors.

- The Fiji/ImageJ Jython script was developed with assistance from both ChatGPT
  (OpenAI) and Gemini (Google), which were used to suggest code patterns and
  implementation strategies. The final script was written, validated, and
  executed by the authors.

No AI system was used to generate or interpret biological data, select regions
of interest, or draw scientific conclusions.
